I completed my BSc degree in Statistics at METU, the best technical university in Turkey, as the **valedictorian** of the 2017 cohort. In 2020, I completed the Master of Science Program at METU as a **valedictorian** once again, with several publications and a winner prize at a national statistics competition. My main research interests are machine learning and deep learning applications for sequential data, especially time series. I love living in **Ankara.**
